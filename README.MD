# KVM VFIO Setup

This is the beginning of a setup to deploy KVM with the intention to automate VFIO (Virtual Function I/O) configuration for utilizing hardware without emulation in VM's. Example: KVM for Windows Gaming with a non-emulated GPU or Linux for machine learning. We will try to integrate some other projects into this as git submodules and pull in via Salt.

Main Tools Used will be Saltstack and Python.
